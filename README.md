# Wordle-Game
 The Wordle Game app employs client-side technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. UI elements are constructed using HTML/CSS, while game logic and user interaction are managed through JavaScript. This approach facilitates seamless gameplay directly in the browser without server communication, providing a fast and interactive experience.
